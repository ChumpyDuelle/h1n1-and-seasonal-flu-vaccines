    "        * **Primary**: can we predict whether people got H1N1 vaccines using data collected in the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey?\n",
    "        * **Secondary**: can we infer which variables of this survey are most causing a change in vaccination status for H1N1?\n",
    "        * **Tertiary**: can we provide actionable recommendations to improve the rate of innoculation against H1N1?\n",
    "* How did we pick the data analysis question(s) that we did?\n",
    "    * With respect to each of the above questions, we picked the questions as a result of the following thought process:\n",
    "        * Ultimately, what we would like to be able to do is increase the population's rate of innoculation against highly infectious respiratory diseases. In order to know what would have to be done to take action in this way, we have to understand what variables are most causing a change in vaccination status for individuals, as well as which of those variables we can actually control. Finally, we can confirm whether or not our understanding of these relationships can be used to accurately predict vaccination status for individuals.\n",
    "* Why are these questions important from a business perspective?\n",
    "    * These questions are important from a business perspective because they allow public health officials to make informed decisions about what actions they can take to attempt to improve the resiliency of the population against highly infectious respiratory diseases.\n",

Currently delineated metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas are based on application of 2010 standards (which appeared in the Federal Register on June 28, 2010) to 2010 Census and 2011-2015 American Community Survey data, as well as 2018 Population Estimates Program data.

    "Looking at the above collection of unique values in each feature, we can see that all of our numeric features have the expected number of values, as laid out by the feature descriptions above. However, we don't yet know what the various value counts for the object type columns are, so let's take a look at those briefly. In addition to simply understanding what sorts of answers were available on the survey, this will help us determine what sort of transformation would be appropriate for each feature."

    "    * seasonal_vaccine\n",
    "        * Whether respondent received seasonal flu vaccine. (binary)\n",
    "    * Based on these correlations, we can say that there may be a moderate relationship between these features and the target. However, in order to know whether or not this correlation is causative, we will need to explore these relationships in our modeling process. As we know, correlation does not necessarily mean causation; it just gives us some insight into what we may want to explore.\n",
    "* Finally, there are several feature which have correlations higher than 0.5:\n",

    "So it looks like all of our values are either 1 or 0, again as expected. In terms of what we could do to rectify the null counts in this column, we could potentially impute the mean or the median, but both of these approaches will likely fudge the data. If we impute the mean, we change the distribution of the entire column from binary to something else, so we can't do that. If we impute the median, we drastically sway an already imbalanced distribution even more in favor of the majority, so we can't really do that, either. With respect to this column missing as many values as it does, the best approach for this feature may simply be to drop it altogether."
