# H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccines

**Authors**: Ian Butler, Red the dog

## Overview

A one-paragraph overview of the project, including the business problem, data, methods, results and recommendations.

## Business Problem

Summary of the business problem we are trying to solve, and the data questions that we plan to answer to solve them.

***

Questions to consider:

* What are the business's pain points related to ths project?
    * The business's pain points related to this project are these:
        * **Primary**: can we predict whether people got H1N1 vaccines using data collected in the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey?
        * **Secondary**: can we infer which variables of this survey are most causing a change in vaccination status for H1N1?
        * **Tertiary**: can we provide actionable recommendations to improve the rate of innoculation against H1N1?
* How did we pick the data analysis question(s) that we did?
    * With respect to each of the above questions, we picked the questions as a result of the following thought process:
        * Ultimately, what we would like to be able to do is increase the population's rate of innoculation against highly infectious respiratory diseases. In order to know what would have to be done to take action in this way, we have to understand what variables are most causing a change in vaccination status for individuals, as well as which of those variables we can actually control. Finally, we can confirm whether or not our understanding of these relationships can be used to accurately predict vaccination status for individuals.
* Why are these questions important from a business perspective?
    * These questions are important from a business perspective because they allow public health officials to make informed decisions about what actions they can take to attempt to improve the resiliency of the population against highly infectious respiratory diseases.

## Data Understanding

Describe the data being used for this project.

***

Questions to consider:

* Where did the data come from?
    * The data comes from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey.
* How do they relate to the data analysis questions?
    * The National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survery relates to the data analysis questions in that this survey was specifically designed to develop an understanding of how peopleâ€™s backgrounds, opinions, and health behaviors are related to their personal vaccination patterns.
* What do the data represent?
    * Each entry in the data represents the survey responses of one individual.
* Who is in the sample?
    * The sample is comprised of individuals from various psychographics and demographics across the United States.

A brief word on MSA:

The United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB) delineates metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas according to published standards that are applied to Census Bureau data. The general concept of a metropolitan or micropolitan statistical area is that of a core area containing a substantial population nucleus, together with adjacent communities having a high degree of economic and social integration with that core. Currently delineated metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas are based on application of 2010 standards (which appeared in the Federal Register on June 28, 2010) to 2010 Census and 2011-2015 American Community Survey data, as well as 2018 Population Estimates Program data. Current metropolitan and micropolitan statistical area delineations were announced by OMB effective March 2020.

## Methods

Describe the process for analyzing or modeling the data.

***

Questions to consider:

* How did you prepare, analyze or model the data?
    * We prepared the data in the following ways:
        * Dropped variables which were either missing half of their values or more than 10% of their values, with no good answer for imputing new values:
            * health_insurance
            * employment_industry
            * employment_occupation
            * income_poverty
        * Executed a OneHotEncoder for all features of the object data type. Given that there was no inherent rank to any of the object features, a OneHotEncoder was applied universally to those data types in lieu of using an OrdinalEncoder for any of them.
    * We analyzed the data in the following ways:
        * Simple dataframe manipulation:
            * Observed measures of central tendency for varioues features
            * Observed distribution of the features and of the target
            * Observed correlation of features to target and features to features
        * Visualized correlation of features and target via heatmapping
    * We modeled the data with the following algorithms:
        * Dummy Classifier
        * Logistic Regression
        * Random Forest
* Why is this approach appropriate given the data and the business problem?
    * The approaches were appropraite given the data and the business problem because they allowed us to eliminate features which could not rightly contribute toward the inference or prediction of the target without arbitrarily skewing the distribution of those features.
